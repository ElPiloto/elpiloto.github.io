<p>Sometimes I&#8217;ll come back to my computer (usually from getting coffee or a pensive pacing session) and see that I&#8217;ve made changes to a file in vim without actually saving those changes.  Did I forget to save actual edits to the file or did I happen to mash on my keyboard accidentally while vim was in the foreground?  </p>
<p>To check what you&#8217;ve changed since the last time you saved a file, you can use the following command to pull up a diff of the file contents on disk against the file contents open in your vim buffer:</p>
