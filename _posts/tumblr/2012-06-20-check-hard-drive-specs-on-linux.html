<p>I recently needed to check whether or not my computer&#8217;s hard drive was IDE or SATA.  Some googling and poking around led me to this.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can replace /dev/sda with any other hard drives you may have (e.g. /dev/sdb).  This output will give you the devices model number, which allows you to look up the specifics online.  If anyone knows a shorter way of checking for IDE vs. SATA, let me know.</p>
