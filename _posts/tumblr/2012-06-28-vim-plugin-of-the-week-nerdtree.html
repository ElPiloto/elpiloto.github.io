<a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree#readme">VIM Plugin of the week: NERDtree</a><br/><p>I was at Hack n&#8217; Jill last week and a friend told me about NERDtree, a VIM plugin for easily exploring any project hierarchy in vim.  It&#8217;s super easy to install, there&#8217;s no reason not to try this out.  Definitely take advantage of the bookmark feature which acts like shortcuts to your favorite project files/directories.</p>
