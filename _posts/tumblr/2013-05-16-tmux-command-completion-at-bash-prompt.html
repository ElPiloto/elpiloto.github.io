<p>After checking out git&#8217;s amazing git command-completion and my <a href="http://sageagainstthemachine.us/blog/2013/04/26/adding-tab-completion-for-your-bash-scripts/">recent discovery</a> of how to implement your own command-completion for bash scripts, I began to wonder why tmux didn&#8217;t have this feature.  After some searching, I found that the tmux installation includes a script file for command-completion in bash!  In the tmux-1.8 distribution, you should find a folder titled &#8220;examples" which contains a file &#8220;bash_completion_tmux.sh".  Just source this file in your .bashrc and you&#8217;re done!!</p>
