<p>Just recently had to look up how to return to my cursor position after jumping to the beginning of my file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jump to old/prev cursor position: Ctrl + o <br/>Jump to new/next cursor position: Ctrl + i </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sample usage scenario: You need to look up a variable definition at the top of your file.</p>
<ol><li>Type &#8220;gg" to jump to the beginning of your file</li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve seen your variable name, simply type &#8220;Ctrl + o" to jump back to where you were.</li>
<li>Someone in your office farted and in your laughter you forgot the variable name again! Hit &#8220;Ctrl + i" to jump back to the top of the file and then hit &#8220;Ctrl + o" to go back to your position further down into the file.</li>
</ol>
