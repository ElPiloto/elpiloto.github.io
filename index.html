<li>Edit macro:
Record macro to register f: qf to start recording macro to register f
Specify macro:Â <Random macro commands of your choosing>
Stop recording macro:Â q
Open new area to modify macro and paste it:

<ul>
<li>:sp new</li>
<li>&ldquo;f (this is the magic here &ndash; I didn’t realize macros were just stored as
characters in a register!)
Edit macro: <Random macro modifications>
Select macro: <Your favorite method for selecting the edited macro>
Yank macro back to register f: “fy
Use updated macro: @f
TADA!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vim Sessions:Â 
You can use the :mksession command to create a vim script that will restore
your current editing session. Â By default, :mksession will save your currently
opened buffers, the current directory, tabs, splits, and folds you have open,
but you can add more things by modifying the “sessionoptions&#8221; variable. Â You
can save multiple sessions by calling the :mksession command with an argument
specifying the session name, which you can later invoke to load a particular
session.
Example 1: Using the generic session specifier
Open up vim and open up a few tabs or splits or whatever you normally do when
your coding.
Save the session:Â :mksession &ndash; this will save our session to a file named
Session.vim, which is the default session name.
Quit vim: :qa
Start vim with the default session name: vim -S
TADA!
Example 2: Saving and loading a specific session:
Just like before, open up vim normally and open up random tabs and files and
splits and whatchamajiggers.
Save the session with the name your_splits_give_them_to_me: :mks
your_splits_give_them_to_me (Notice that we can specify a file name that
doesn’t end in .vim and also that we can abbreviate :mksession to :mks)
Quit vim: :qa
Start vim with the session name your_splits_give_them_to_me: vim &ndash;
S your_splits_give_them_to_me
TADA!</li>
<li>COMBO SECTION: Paste register into the command line and the new register I
learned!
Sometimes it’s useful to use the contents of a register in a command. Â For
instance, let’s say you’re editing a bash script, bludgeon.sh, and you want to
actually test it before you continue adding functionality to the script.

<ul>
<li>How a naive user might do this:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Exit vim
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Execute the script: bash bludgeon.sh
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Open the file in vim again: vim bludgeon.sh</li>
<li>How a less naive user might do this:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Execute a command from the terminal using vim’s filter (!) by
typing: &ldquo;:! bash bludgeon.sh&rdquo;</li>
<li>How I would do this:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Instead of typing out bludgeon.sh, use the special % register
to paste the filename into vim’s command line:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &#8221;:! bash &lt;Ctrl-r>%&ldquo;
That explains two tips:
The % register which contains the name of the file you’re currently editing.
Pasting a register into vim’s command-line: &lt;Ctrl-r> register
TADA! Â Happy VIM’ing!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When people learn vim it’s pretty common to learn search and replace, typically
taught in this form:
:%s/food/ramen noodles, again/g
This will search through the entire file and replace the phrase food with ramen
noodles, again. Â People even go as far as to learn the following variant which
asks for confirmation before replacing each instance:
:%s/food/ramen noodles, again/gc
Some people might even know that the g at the end tells vim to replace every
instance on a line (omitting the g tells vim to replace only the first
occurrence on each line). However,Â what people often don’t learn is how truly
customizable this command is.</p>

<h1>1 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Feature:Â You can use (almost) any character as a</h1>

<p>delimiter.
I always thought you had to use / as the delimiter, but it turns out you can
use any character (except for space and alphanumeric characters). Â So we could
do the following in place of the above: Â  Â Â </p>

<pre><code>* :%s+food+ramen noodles, again+g
  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â OR
* :%s|food|ramen noodles, again|g
</code></pre>

<p>Why would we want to use this? Â Well, if you ever wanted to use / as part of
your search or replace expressions, you would have to escape it using vim’s
escape character (backslash) . Â Let’s assume we want to replace each instance
of / with ./ To accomplish that, we’d have to do the following if we stuck with
the default delimiter:</p>

<pre><code>* :%s/\//.\//g
</code></pre>

<p>However, if we used an alternative delimiter, such asÂ @ we would have an
expression which is much easier to use, read, and type:</p>

<pre><code>* :%s@/@./@g
</code></pre>

<p>No escaping needed, tada!</p>

<h1>2 That’s Not a Bug, That’s a Feature: You don’t always have to include a</h1>

<p>search pattern!
Let’s say you previously looked for &ldquo;a_good_time&rdquo; using this command:</p>

<pre><code>* /a_good_time
</code></pre>

<p>And after some time you decide you want to replace it with something more
specific, you could use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>* :%s//coke_and_hookers/g
  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â OR equivalently
* :%s^^coke_and_hookers^g
</code></pre>

<p>When you don’t specify a search expression in the substitute command, vim
automatically uses the last value you searched (or substituted for) as the
search expression!</p>

<h1>3_The_Feature_Is_In_Your_Hands:Â You can manipulate the range on which</h1>

<p>substitutions take place!
The generic version of substitute uses % as the range, which means the entire
file, but vim allows much more flexibity in specifying the range. Â How do we
specify ranges? Â Quite intuitively! Ranges can be specified from a starting
point to an ending point, thus the only thing to really learn is to specify
these points. Â They are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>* . Â the current line number
* $ the last line in the file
* % the entire file
* any number specifies that line number in the file
* ‘t would specify the location of marker t (markers are a way of marking
  locations in the file so you can return to them later)
* /some_pattern would go to the next line where we find the string
  “some_pattern"
* ?some_pattern would go to the previous line where we find the string
  “some_pattern"
</code></pre>

<p>You specify ranges as points separated by a comma. Â Here are some example
ranges as used in a substitution command:</p>

<pre><code>* :1,3s/hello/goodbye/g - this would replace all instances of hello with
  goodbye on lines 1-3 of our file
* :1,$s/hello/goodbye/g - this would search through the entire file Note
  that 1,$ is equivalent to %
* :1,.s/hello/goodbye/g - this would search from the beginning of our file
  to the current line
* :.,/aloha/s/hello/goodbye/g - this would search from the current line to
  the first line after the current line containingÂ alohaÂ in it and
  replace hello with goodbye
</code></pre>

<p>Note: If you specify a range that goes backwards, vim will prompt you to
reverse the order.
And there you have it! Now you can be pickier with your substitutions than a
vegan on an airplane. Â Next on your to do list should be learning vim regular
expressions, specifically escape characters and quantifiers (for advanced
searching) and grouping and backreferences (for advanced replacing).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I’ll come back to my computer (usually from getting coffee or a
pensive pacing session) and see that I’ve made changes to a file in vim without
actually saving those changes. Â Did I forget to save actual edits to the file

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As an avid Matlab user, I frequently supplement the built-in functionality with
source code from Matlab’s_File_Exchange. Â Sometimes it’s simple, but extremely
convenient functionality I’d rather not code myself, such as mtit. Â Sometimes
it’s more esoteric code specific to a domain or file standard that I’d never
code myself such as plot2svg. Â All in all, Matlab’s File Exchange has proven
to be a real resource. Â However, for the longest time, I only acquired new
File Exchange code when I explicitly needed functionality unavailable in
Matlab. Â 
But that’s only half the benefit of the File Exchange. Â There are libraries
upon libraries of code on the internet aimed at providing functionality users
wouldn’t ever imagine (think jQuery or any of a million web frameworks aimed at
adding radically simplified interfaces to a unified combination of programming
elements). Â Given that I might benefit from code I didn’t even know existed,
how could these unsung ones-and-zeroes be brought to my attention? Â 
Enter Matlab’s_File_Exchange_Pick_of_the_Week_blog. Â Each Friday, one of two
Matlab employees ( Brett &amp; Jiro ) posts about his “favorite user-
contributed submissions from the File Exchange.&ldquo; Â Once I found this blog, I
subscribed to its feed and now every Friday I eagerly await what goodie will be
bestowed upon me next.
Unfortunately, the last few blog posts have garnered my disdain. Â Instead of
the usually useful picks, Brett and Jiro have chosen poorly veiled “picks&rdquo; that
promote Matlab’s new Apps feature. Â </p>

<pre><code>* Oh hey all you scientific programmers, check out this arcade-style
  shooter written in Matlab - did we mention it’s the first user-
  contributed App?
  Â 
* Matlab users: if you found galaga useful for analyzing data, look at this
  map-of-the-stars file exchange submission written by one of the Matlab
  employees that’s actually an App, a new feature in Matlab!!
  Â 
* Check out this, user-submitted content: it’s an App centered on two e-
  books written by one of Matlab’s original authors, Cleve. Â Don’t worry,
  the App itself is also written by Cleve so you know it’s user-submitted.
</code></pre>

<p>It’s their company and their blog, they can do what they want with it, but I
can’t help but feel slightly wronged. Â I can’t really speculate on possible
repercussions this not so subtle corporate whoring might have &ndash; Matlab has
entrenched itself as a mission critical part of so many getups &ndash; but I hope
maybe this post will make the point to the folks at Mathworks that they should
consider treating us with respect instead of somehow believing that they can
covertly advertise through a medium we choose to subscribe to under the
pretenses that it will contain actual utility. Â I’m not calling anyone a bad
person or particularly furious about the situation, it’s more of a “shame on
you&#8221; kinda thing. Â Did I mention Matlab has a new Apps feature?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently found myself needing to pass the contents of a variable length cell
array as arguments to a function that accepted a variable number of arguments
(via Matlab’s varargin functionality). Â I thought this would be a real
problem, but was astonished at how easy it was.
Assuming we have a cell array defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code> my_cell_array = {‘You’, ‘Say’, ‘Aloha’, ‘I’, ‘Say’, ‘Aloha’};
</code></pre>

<p>And that we’re trying to call Matlab’s load() function with the following form:</p>

<pre><code> load(filename, varargin)
</code></pre>

<p>All we have to do is the following:</p>

<pre><code> load(‘some_random_matlab_file.mat’, my_cell_array{:})
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s all it takes. Â Just in case you’re curious, the particular use case
that led me to need this functionality was that I needed to load a list of user
specified variables from a .mat file in a toolbox I’m working on.</p>
