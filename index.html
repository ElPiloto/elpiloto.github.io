  <p>You know what’s great? Ice cream, bourbon, and babies riding (safely) on the backs of puppies are some obvious answers.  Here’s a subtler one: <em>Markov chains</em>! </p>

<p>They serve as the basis of many approximate inference techniques and today we’re going to take a preparatory step towards learning about Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. </p>

<p><ins>Expository note:</ins> sometimes I find it beneficial to motivate and situate terms and objects after introducting them, so if something comes out of the blue, just trust me that it will get explained.  And if it doesn’t get explained, feel free to email me and I will provide you with my address with which you can setup a fiery protest outside of my residence with signs like “We trusted you” and “Betrayal is a four-letter word: luis”</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="markov-chain-definition">Markov Chain Definition</h5>
<p>A Markov chain can be defined via the following:<br /><br />
1. <script type="math/tex">t</script>, a set of <script type="math/tex">N</script> <strong>indices</strong> (you can think of this as time for the …time being)<br />
2. <script type="math/tex">S</script>, a set of <script type="math/tex">K</script> <strong>states</strong>: <script type="math/tex">s_1, s_2 ... s_K</script><br />
3. <script type="math/tex">T</script>, a <strong>transition matrix</strong> specifying the probability of transitioning from state <script type="math/tex">s_i</script> to <script type="math/tex">s_j</script>, for all possible pairs of states.<br />
4. <script type="math/tex">P_0</script>, a <strong>probability distribution</strong> over starting states</p>

<p>Let’s unpack this by using a toy example.  We can define a Markov chain over the sites I visit at any point in time.  For simplicity’s sake, let’s keep it to two sites I use: reddit and facebook.  </p>

<div align="center"><img src="/images/latex/mc.svg" /></div>

<p>In this scenario, <script type="math/tex">S</script>, our state space, contains only two states ( i.e. <script type="math/tex">K = 2</script>): <script type="math/tex">s_1 = reddit</script>, <script type="math/tex">s_2 = facebook</script>, depicted as the vertices in the graph above.  </p>

<p>You’ll also notice that our graph has some directed edges with numbers on them.  This is one way of representing our transition matrix: the number on each edge indicates the transition probability of going from one state to the next.  For instance, the probability of going from reddit to facebook is <script type="math/tex">0.2</script>  Below we explicitly show the transition matrix <script type="math/tex">T</script>, where <script type="math/tex">T_{ij}</script> indicates the probability of transitioning to <script type="math/tex">s_i</script> from <script type="math/tex">s_j</script>:  </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
T = \begin{bmatrix} 0.8 & 0.75\\0.2 & 0.25\end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Alright, let’s give ourselves a round of applause: we defined two out of the four components of a Markov chain.  </p>

<p><strong>Now what are these indices I was talking about?</strong>  Indices tell us when we are observing our state. At 8:02 PM, I could either be on reddit or facebook, at 8:03 PM might be on either reddit or facebook, etc.  My example is slightly encumbered by the fact that we usually think of time as continuous, but let’s pretend that we live in a world of discrete time, where I can only change webpages on the change of the minute.  Futhermore, just to make it easy, let’s say we’re going to start at 8:00 PM exactly and continue up until 8:59 PM.  </p>

<p>With these assumptions, we can observe our state (reddit or facebook) exactly 60 times: at time <script type="math/tex">t_1 = 8:00 PM </script> I can be on either reddit or facebook, at time <script type="math/tex">t_2 = 8:01 PM</script>, I can be on either reddit or facebook, etc. all the way up to our last index, time <script type="math/tex">t_{60} = 8:59 PM</script>  </p>

<p>So for this weird, chop-suey-time-into-discrete-chunks-and-the-universe-only-exists-for-60-minutes example, our set of indices would have 60 ordered values ( <script type="math/tex"> N = 60 </script>) because we started this section by saying that our indices tell us when we are observing out state and we only have 60 time points.  </p>

<p>Now let’s bust out the old google translate on this to make it a bit more rigorous.  </p>

<p>Let’s consider some arbitrary time <script type="math/tex">t_{n}</script> a.k.a. our <script type="math/tex">n^{th}</script> index, we observe one of two possible values from our state space (reddit or facebook) with some as yet undefined probability (recall: our transition matrix <script type="math/tex">T</script> defines the probability of transitioning from one state to another, but this is not the same as the probability of being in that state).  If this sounds like a random variable, that’s because it is a random variable.</p>

<p><code>Informal proof: if it looks like a random variable, swims like a random variable,<br />and quacks like a random variable, then it's probably a duck.</code></p>

<p>So, we can use the notation <script type="math/tex">X_{t_n}</script> to denote the random variable over states at index <script type="math/tex">n</script>.  Considering that we have <script type="math/tex">N</script> time points or indices, then we actually have <script type="math/tex">N</script> random variables - each of which operate over the same state space.  Let’s call these random variables <script type="math/tex">X_{t_n}</script> for <script type="math/tex">{t_n} = 1 ... N</script>, remembering that our indices or times are a sequence - that is they are ordered.  </p>

<p>Finally! We have some sense of what these indices are: our Markov chain defines <script type="math/tex">N</script> copies of a random variable <script type="math/tex">X</script> - our index tells us which copy.  </p>

<p>I found this concept of indices to be slightly tricky when looking at other types of random processes.  It’s tempting to think of the index as time and quite appropriate in this context of Markov chains, but I find the much more useful interpretation is that of having a bunch of copies of a random variable and the index telling you to which copy you are referring.  I will continue to use time and index interchangeably to reinforce this.</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> we’ve acquired knowledge of three out of the four components of a Markov chain and still have a ways to go to really understand what a Markov chain is.  </p>

<hr />

<p>So let’s backtrack a little bit to the transition matrix now that we’re viewing our Markov chain as a sequence of random variables..  Our transition matrix <script type="math/tex">T</script>, specifically <script type="math/tex">T_{i,j}</script>, tells us the probability of transitioning to some state <script type="math/tex">s_i</script> given that we’re at some state <script type="math/tex">s_j</script>.  That last bit implies that at some time, let’s call it <script type="math/tex">t_n</script>, we’re at <script type="math/tex">s_j</script> and the transition matrix gives us the probability over states for the next time, <script type="math/tex">t_{n+1}</script>:   </p>
<center> $$P(X_{t_{n+1}} = s_i | X_{t_n} = s_j) = T_{i,j}$$ </center>

<p>Well that’s convenient: if I know which state I’m currently in, then all I need to do to predict the next state is look at this transition matrix.  </p>

<p>Let’s consider the inconvenient alternative.  The inconvenient alternative would be a case where to figure out the next state, I have to consider not just the state at time <script type="math/tex">t_n</script>, but the one before that <script type="math/tex">t_{n-1}</script>, and the one before that, and the one before that, all the way to some initial state.  Well that would be a serious pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Let’s get a better feeling for why.  I want to learn the probability of being on reddit at <script type="math/tex">t_3</script>, <script type="math/tex">X_{t_3} = reddit</script>  If we lived in inconvenient land, we would have to consider all possible histories, <script type="math/tex">X_{n-1} ... X_{1}</script>, of length 2:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[

\begin{align}
P(X_{t_3} = reddit &|\ X_2 = reddit, X_1 = reddit)  \\
P(X_{t_3} = reddit &|\ X_2 = reddit, X_1 = facebook)  \\
P(X_{t_3} = reddit &|\ X_2 = facebook, X_1 = reddit)  \\
P(X_{t_3} = reddit &|\ X_2 = facebook, X_1 = facebook) 
\end{align}
 %]]></script>

<p>You could see how this blows up if we wanted to look at <script type="math/tex">X_4</script> or <script type="math/tex">X_40</script>.  For <script type="math/tex">X_n</script>, we’d have <script type="math/tex">K^{n-1}</script> possible histories we’d have to consider (recall <script type="math/tex">K</script> is the number of states).  So in our toy case, for <script type="math/tex">n = 3</script> and <script type="math/tex">K = 2</script> possible states, we have <script type="math/tex">2^{2} = 4 </script> possible histories, which is exactly what we see above.   </p>

<p>So I have an idea: let’s <em>not</em> do the inconvenient thing (go America), let’s embrace the Markov property. Markov chains restrict the set of all possible probabilities over sequences to only those which can be explained in terms of “local dynamics”.  Essentially, they say, “the past doesn’t matter, the only thing that affects my future is the present” - it sounds like some new-age, positive-thinking, crispy-hippie mantra like “the past is in the past” (except that Markov chains are actually useful to society :P).   More formally, the <strong>Markov property</strong> says:  </p>
<center>$$ P(X_{t+1} | X_{t}) = P(X_{t+1} | X_t, X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}&#8230; X_{1}) $$ </center>

<p>Now we can get to the last component.  We have our convenient transition matrix (thanks Markov - you da man) which tells us the probability of a next state given our current state, but what about the first state i.e. <script type="math/tex">X_{t_1}</script>?  By definition the first state never comes after another state, thus we can’t use our transition matrix for <script type="math/tex">X_{t_1}</script>.  That’s where <script type="math/tex">P_0</script> comes in - all it does is provide a probability over starting states!  For instance, we can define <script type="math/tex">P_0</script> for our starting state as:  </p>

<center>$$P_0(X_{t_1} = reddit) = 0.5, P_0(X_{t_1} = facebook) $$ </center>

<p><strong>Congratulations:</strong> we’ve just defined the last component of the Markov chain.  Celebrate in your preferred fashion, but please don’t get too rowdy - Markov chain riots are predictably bad.  Personally, I’d like to celebrate with a nice recap.</p>

<p>A Markov chain is a probability distribution over a sequence of outcomes indexed by a discrete set <script type="math/tex">t</script>.  We can think of the outcome for index <script type="math/tex">t_{n}</script> as a random variable: <script type="math/tex">X_{t_n}</script>.  Thus, given <script type="math/tex">N</script> indices, we have <script type="math/tex">N</script> random variables:  <script type="math/tex">X_{t_1}, X_{t_2} ... X_{t_N}</script>.  The Markov assumptiom allows us to represent this distribution over sequence using just the transition matrix <script type="math/tex">T</script>, where <script type="math/tex">T_{i,j}</script> represents the probability of transitioning from state <script type="math/tex">s_j</script> at time <script type="math/tex">t_n</script> to state <script type="math/tex">s_i</script> at time <script type="math/tex">t_{n+1}</script> and a probability distribution over starting states, <script type="math/tex">P_0</script>.</p>

<p>For our toy example, we had N = 60, but <strong>you need to know</strong> that the index set, <script type="math/tex">t</script> could be infinite i.e. <script type="math/tex"> N = \infty </script>  We’ll use this later. As a bonus, it’s worth mentioning we can even have an index set which is continuous, these are called continuous-time Markov chains.</p>

<!--
Now we need some way to actually specify the probability of websites I'll be on over the course of the hour - sounds like a [nightmare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sok_KbPG6iw).  This is where the *Markov property* comes in saying that the probability over next states only depends on my current state: $$ P(X_{t+1} | P(X_{t}) = P(X_{t+1} | P(X_{0}, X_{1}, X_{2} ... X_{t}) $$

  <p>After checking out git&#8217;s amazing git command-completion and my <a href="http://sageagainstthemachine.us/blog/2013/04/26/adding-tab-completion-for-your-bash-scripts/">recent discovery</a> of how to implement your own command-completion for bash scripts, I began to wonder why tmux didn&#8217;t have this feature.  After some searching, I found that the tmux installation includes a script file for command-completion in bash!  In the tmux-1.8 distribution, you should find a folder titled &#8220;examples&#8221; which contains a file &#8220;bash_completion_tmux.sh&#8221;.  Just source this file in your .bashrc and you&#8217;re done!!</p>

      VIM Tips: Editing Macros, Sessions, Command-line Registers, & a New Register!
    </a></h1>
  
</header>
<section>
  <h1>Edit macro</h1>
1. Record the macro: I&#8217;m gunna assume you&#8217;ve already recorded a macro to register <code>f</code><br>
2. Open a new area to edit the macro (this could be in your current window, but I&#8217;d prefer to do it in a new split):  <code>:sp new ENTER</code><br>
3. Paste the macro contents as if they were a register! <code>"f</code>  This is the magic right here: I didn&#8217;t realize macros were just stored as characters in a register!
4. Now modify the macro as you, please, yank it back <code>fy</code> after selecting it visually or otherwise<br>
5. Finally use your modified macro: <code>@f</code><br>
6. Feel like a f<code>*</code>ckin&#8217; boss<br><br>

<h1>Vim Sessions:</h1>

You can use the <code>:mksession</code> command to create a vim script that will restore your current editing session.  By default, :mksession will save your currently opened buffers, the current directory, tabs, splits, and folds you have open, but you can add more things by modifying the &#8220;sessionoptions&#8221; variable.  You can save multiple sessions by calling the :mksession command with an argument specifying the session name, which you can later invoke to load a particular session.<br><br>

<h2>Example 1: Using the generic session specifier</h2>

Open up vim and open up a few tabs or splits or whatever you normally do when you&#8217;re coding.

Save the session: <code>:mksession ENTER</code> - this will save our session to a file named Session.vim, which is the default session name.

Quit vim: :qa<br>

Start vim with the default session name: vim -S
<br><br>
Example 2: Saving and loading a specific session:
Just like before, open up vim normally and open up random tabs and files and splits and whatchamajiggers.
Save the session with the name your_splits_give_them_to_me: :mks your_splits_give_them_to_me (Notice that we can specify a file name that doesn&#8217;t end in .vim and also that we can abbreviate :mksession to :mks)
Quit vim: :qa
Start vim with the session name your_splits_give_them_to_me: vim -S your_splits_give_them_to_me

	<h1>COMBO SECTION: Paste register into the command line and the new register I learned!</h1>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s useful to use the contents of a register in a command.  For instance, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re editing a bash script, <em>bludgeon.sh</em>, and you want to actually test it before you continue adding functionality to the script.</p>
<ul><li>How a naive user might do this:</li>
</ul><p>           Exit vim<br/>           Execute the script: bash bludgeon.sh<br/>           Open the file in vim again: vim bludgeon.sh</p>
<ul><li>How a less naive user might do this:</li>
</ul><p>           Execute a command from the terminal using vim&#8217;s filter (!) by typing: &#8220;:! bash bludgeon.sh&#8221;</p>
<ul><li>How I would do this:</li>
</ul><p>           Instead of typing out bludgeon.sh, use the special % register to paste the filename into vim&#8217;s command line:</p>
<p>           &#8221;:! bash &lt;Ctrl-r&gt;%&#8221;</p>
<p>That explains two tips:</p>
<p>The % register which contains the name of the file you&#8217;re currently editing.</p>
<p>Pasting a register into vim&#8217;s command-line: &lt;Ctrl-r&gt; register</p>
<p>TADA!  Happy VIM&#8217;ing!</p>

      VIM: Substitute Teacher
    </a></h1>

<section>
  <p>When people learn vim it&#8217;s pretty common to learn search and replace, typically taught in this form:</p>
<p><em>:%s/food/ramen noodles, again/g</em></p>
<p>This will search through the entire file and replace the phrase <em>food</em> with <em>ramen noodles, again</em>.  People even go as far as to learn the following variant which asks for confirmation before replacing each instance:</p>
<p><em>:%s/food/ramen noodles, again/gc</em></p>
<p>Some people might even know that the g at the end tells vim to replace every instance on a line (omitting the g tells vim to replace only the first occurrence on each line). However, what people often don&#8217;t learn is how truly customizable this command is.</p>
<p><span><strong>#1 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Feature:</strong> </span>You can use (almost) any character as a delimiter.</p>
<p>I always thought you had to use <em>/</em> as the delimiter, but it turns out you can use any character (except for space and alphanumeric characters).  So we could do the following in place of the above:     </p>
<ul><li><em>:%s+food+ramen noodles, again+g</em><br/>                 OR</li>
<li><em>:%s|food|ramen noodles, again|g</em></li>
</ul><p>Why would we want to use this?  Well, if you ever wanted to use <em>/</em> as part of your search or replace expressions, you would have to escape it using vim&#8217;s escape character (backslash) .  Let&#8217;s assume we want to replace each instance of / with ./ To accomplish that, we&#8217;d have to do the following if we stuck with the default delimiter:</p>
<ul><li><em>:%s/\//.\//g</em></li>
</ul><p>However, if we used an alternative delimiter, such as <em>@</em> we would have an expression which is much easier to use, read, and type:</p>
<ul><li><em>:%s@/@./@g</em></li>
</ul><p>No escaping needed, tada!</p>
<p><span><strong>#2 That&#8217;s Not a Bug, That&#8217;s a Feature:</strong></span> You don&#8217;t always have to include a search pattern!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you previously looked for <em>&#8220;a_good_time&#8221;</em> using this command:</p>
<ul><li><em>/a_good_time</em></li>
</ul><p>And after some time you decide you want to replace it with something more specific, you could use the following command:</p>
<ul><li><em>:%s//coke_and_hookers/g</em><br/>                 OR equivalently</li>
<li><em>:%s^^coke_and_hookers^g</em></li>
</ul><p>When you don&#8217;t specify a search expression in the substitute command, vim automatically uses the last value you searched (or substituted for) as the search expression!</p>
<p><strong><u>#3 The Feature Is In Your Hands:</u> </strong>You can manipulate the range on which substitutions take place!</p>
<p>The generic version of substitute uses % as the range, which means the entire file, but vim allows much more flexibity in specifying the range.  How do we specify ranges?  Quite intuitively! Ranges can be specified from a starting point to an ending point, thus the only thing to really learn is to specify these points.  They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>.  the current line number</li>
<li><em>$</em> the last line in the file</li>
<li><em>%</em> the entire file</li>
<li>any number specifies that line number in the file</li>
<li><em>&#8216;t</em> would specify the location of marker t (markers are a way of marking locations in the file so you can return to them later)</li>
<li><em>/some_pattern</em> would go to the next line where we find the string &#8220;some_pattern&#8221;</li>
<li><em>?some_pattern</em> would go to the previous line where we find the string &#8220;some_pattern&#8221;</li>
</ul><p>You specify ranges as points separated by a comma.  Here are some example ranges as used in a substitution command:</p>
<ul><li><em>:1,3s/hello/goodbye/g</em> - this would replace all instances of hello with goodbye on lines 1-3 of our file</li>
<li><em>:1,$s/hello/goodbye/g</em> - this would search through the entire file <strong>Note</strong> that <em>1,$</em> is equivalent to <em>%</em></li>
<li><em>:1,.s/hello/goodbye/g</em> - this would search from the beginning of our file to the current line</li>
<li><em>:.,/aloha/s/hello/goodbye/g</em> - this would search from the current line to the first line after the current line containing <em>aloha </em>in it and replace hello with goodbye</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you specify a range that goes backwards, vim will prompt you to reverse the order.</p>
<p>And there you have it! Now you can be pickier with your substitutions than a vegan on an airplane.  Next on your to do list should be learning vim regular expressions, specifically escape characters and quantifiers (for advanced searching) and grouping and backreferences (for advanced replacing).</p>

      VIM Tips: DiffOrig a.k.a. What the Crap Changes Did I Make?

<section>
  <p>Sometimes I&#8217;ll come back to my computer (usually from getting coffee or a pensive pacing session) and see that I&#8217;ve made changes to a file in vim without actually saving those changes.  Did I forget to save actual edits to the file or did I happen to mash on my keyboard accidentally while vim was in the foreground?  </p>
<p>To check what you&#8217;ve changed since the last time you saved a file, you can use the following command to pull up a diff of the file contents on disk against the file contents open in your vim buffer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:DiffOrig</p>
</blockquote>

      MATLAB: Unpack Cell Array to Function Arguments
    </a></h1>
  
</header>
<section>
  <p>I recently found myself needing to pass the contents of a variable length cell array as arguments to a function that accepted a variable number of arguments (via Matlab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/varargin.html" target="_blank">varargin</a> functionality).  I thought this would be a real problem, but was astonished at how easy it was.</p>
<p>Assuming we have a cell array defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my_cell_array = {&#8216;You&#8217;, &#8216;Say&#8217;, &#8216;Aloha&#8217;, &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;Say&#8217;, &#8216;Aloha&#8217;};</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that we&#8217;re trying to call Matlab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/load.html" target="_blank">load()</a> function with the following form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>load(filename, varargin)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All we have to do is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>load(&#8216;some_random_matlab_file.mat&#8217;, my_cell_array{:})</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s all it takes.  Just in case you&#8217;re curious, the particular use case that led me to need this functionality was that I needed to load a list of user specified variables from a .mat file in a toolbox I&#8217;m working on.</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree#readme">VIM Plugin of the week: NERDtree</a><br/><p>I was at Hack n&#8217; Jill last week and a friend told me about NERDtree, a VIM plugin for easily exploring any project hierarchy in vim.  It&#8217;s super easy to install, there&#8217;s no reason not to try this out.  Definitely take advantage of the bookmark feature which acts like shortcuts to your favorite project files/directories.</p>
