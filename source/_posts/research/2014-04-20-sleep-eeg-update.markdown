### Classification results   
Last time I showed a plot for CV accuracy of wake data generated by looking at individual time bins, but using all possible frequencies.  This plot is the logical next step: it considers individual frequencies - which I did for only the most promising time bins (again independently).  I didn't use various regularization penalties this time ($\lambda = 1$ for current plot).  Additionally, this data was z-scored across electrodes for each frequency.

It's harder to pick out the "best" frequencies from this plot (compared to picking the "best" times previously).  The ~alpha band seems to pop out for both subjects, but it might be worthwhile to investigate some of the gamma stuff going on in subject 2.   Also, note that the colorbars are on different scales for both subjects.  Also we can actually get higher classification accuracy for both subjects than we did using all frequencies like last time.

The next analysis step we discussed was to pick a vector consisting of the power across electrodes at a best time and frequency and use this to transform the sleep data and perform cross-validation on the sleep data using this transformed dataset. With the idea being that after we get good sleep cv-accuracy, we could look at the relationship between classifier output and memory.

Sleep Transformation refresher:
- for each time bin of the sleep data, compute dot-product between the z-scored power across electrodes at a given frequency and the "best vector" described above and do this for each frequency

### Next steps
I see two approaches:  
1. glob across subjects and generate transformed-sleep CV results across a range of times and frequencies that seemed promising for both subjects (150ms - 230ms, 7-13Hz)  
2. treat subjects independently, rank (time x freq) pairs by highest CV accuracy and generate transformed-sleep CV results for top 10 (time x freq) pairs
