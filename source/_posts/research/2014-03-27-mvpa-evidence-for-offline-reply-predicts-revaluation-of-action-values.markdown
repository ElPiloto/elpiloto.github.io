#### Ida, Ross Otto, Nathaniel Daw, Ken Norman  


phase 1: 
1 -- A --> 2
  -- B --> 3

phase 2:
1 -- A --> 2cents
  -- B --> 1 cent

phase 3:
2 -- C --> 1 cent
  -- D --> 2 cents

3 -- E --> 10 cents
  -- F --> 25 cents

phase 4: explicitly told, not going to take you to A/B
1 -- A --> 2 cents
  -- B --> 1 cents

what happens in phase 4?

Have your experiences with phase 2 and phase 3 updated your model-free system?

Revaluation magnitude: how much did your behavior change between phase 2 and phase 4?

In absence of direct experience of changes in state/action/reward trajectories, people integrate isolated experiences to update value and inform their choices. How?

People simulate yet unexperienced trajectories of states, actions, and their outcome. These simulated episodes:
a) integrate isolated experience
b) train & update values to guide future choice

### Current Study   
How can we detect offline replay using MVPA?

Have two different MDPs, one gets revaluated, one doesn't get revaluated

testing hypothesis: does change in value of MDP "tag" something for being replayed?  If so, expected that neural correlats of revaluated MDP stronger than non-revaluated MDPs.
