## All the interpretations

Hi Ken,  
   
Here's the scoop.  We can definitely classify wake data (see Figure 1a below) The best time bin for the wake data isn't consistent across all subjects, but it does seem to peak at 230ms, which is consistent with Ehren's results ( compare figure 1b to figure 4: http://compmem.princeton.edu/publications/NewmanNorman10.pdf)  Our classification results aren't as good as Ehren's, he had a peak averaged AUC of 0.7, but I'm not too worried about it - what do you think?  There might be some utility to looking at classification for slightly later timebins (although Ehren's results do peak at 200ms so we might already be looking at the best time bin)   
   
**Classifying sleep?** 	
  
We tried three different sleep classification methods:  
1. Feature selection on all the frequencies within a particular time bin of sleep data.
2. Transform the sleep data using the average pattern of activity across all electrodes at a particular time-bin and frequency of the wake data.
3. Transform the sleep data using the importance map generated by the wake classification instead of the average pattern of activity - this should weight the different electrodes according to how informative they are for wake classification.

For method 1, we're not getting any consistently classifiable timebins across subjects (figure 3a and 3b) which would have been the nicest result.  Additionally, having good wake AUC doesn't mean that subject will have good sleep AUC.

The good news is that methods 2 and 3 show comparable classification AUC to method 1 and sometimes do even better.  Moreover, there isn't a link between good classification for a time bin using method 1 compared to method 2 or 3 (e.g. method 1 classification for subject 2 doesn't do so hot for timebins 152-230, but if you look at <a href="/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/sleep_xform_avg_pattern/sleep_transform_cv_auc_scene_subj2.png"> this plot</a> for method 2 classification for subject 2 - it's pretty clear that that is a helpful time bin ).  These two observations give me confidence that the two sleep transform methods are genuinely helpful preprocessing steps.   
  
Moreover, I've been pretty excited about these sleep transform methods because they frequently, though not always, produce strong bands of good classification for particular timebins of the sleep data.
   
So a logical next question is to determine which method of the two sleep transform methods are better.  It seems like we get stronger bands appearing with method 2 compared to method 3 (you can check this out for yourself just quickly scrolling through the dump of the plots for both <a href="/blog/2014/07/01/sleep-eeg-transform-avg-pattern/">method 2</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/07/01/sleep-eeg-mcduff-transform/">method 3</a>).  There is some agreement between these bands across the two methods, but not always (example plots: <a href="/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/sleep_xform_avg_pattern/sleep_transform_cv_auc_pval_face&scene_subj4.png"> method 2 </a> <a href="/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/sleep_xform_mcduff/sleep_MCDUFF_transform_subj_4_cv_acc_pval_face&scene.png"> method 3</a>   
   

Another degree of freedom is which wake pattern do we use to transform the data: face or scene or face minus scene.  I expected there to be variability between the face and scene transformations, but was surprised to find that the face minus scene didn't just look like the combination of the face and scene results.  Here's an example of that:   

<a href="/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/sleep_xform_avg_pattern/sleep_transform_cv_acc_pval_face_subj8.png">face</a>   

<a href="/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/sleep_xform_avg_pattern/sleep_transform_cv_acc_pval_scene_subj8.png">scene</a>    

<a href="/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/sleep_xform_avg_pattern/sleep_transform_cv_acc_pval_face&scene_subj8.png">face minus scene</a>   
    
This leads me to believe that in the future we should train a sleep classifier that gets both face and a scene transformed data.  The dot-product is sensitive to magnitude, so it could be that there is some useful information in the indivudal face and scene patterns that gets lost when we subtract the two.  What do you think?

The main thing I've taken away from this data is that there are timebins of the sleep data that are classifiable, but that they vary across subjects.  This implication of this being that we have to combine the results of multiple classifiers (tested on different timebins) when we try to connect the classification to subsequent memory - but that the particular classifiers we use will have to vary across subjects.  I think an important thing to figure out is how we want to select which classifiers to use for a subject.  I've gone through and written down a bunch of time bins that I think look good for each subject on the second page of our EEG to-do <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TIOy-4DN4adDDVBKbuRZ2MuI5g-Hg7KWm1nBKjwSHsU/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>, but that was done entirely by hand which doesn't feel right.  

In general, I think we could proceed to linking the classifier to the behavioral or that we could try to improve the classification.  For the latter, I have a crazy idea bout using an "auto-encoder" for preprocessing the sleep data.  We could feed the network sleep data and have it's target be the corresponding wake image.  We could apply this network in a leave-one-out fashion in order to preprocess sleep data for a regular classifier.  Seems like it'd be pretty tough to train the network given the dimensionality of the data and the relatively small number of training samples, but I figured it's worth mentioning.  I'll wait to hear what you think about all this, but I'm going to dedicate my brain cycles to the problem of figuring out how to select which time bins to use.

### Wake Classification Results
These are important because it's likely we'll want to exclude subjects with poor wake cross-validation AUC from subsequent analyses.

**Figure 1a:** This shows the AUC for leave-one-out cross-validation on wake EEG data training on all the z-scored frequencies corresponding to a particular time bin as indicated on the y-axis.  The AUC was calculating by training a classifier that distinguishes between all classes, but only testing on patterns that corresponded to either a celebrity or a landmark.  The AUC was calculated by feeding in the difference between the output for the celebrity one-vs-all classifier and the landmark one-vs-all classifier for each cross-validation fold and the plotted values show the mean AUC across all cross-validation folds.  We had previously looked at the cross-validation accuracy for the first two subjects across a wider range of times, but narrowed it down to these four windows.

**NOTE:** These results were supposed to be for performing feature selection, but I accidentally set the feature selection statistical threshold to 1, which is the same as not using feature selection.  <del>Re-running these results with feature selection.</del>  The results actually containing feature selection are just below.

**Figure 2a)** We plot the AUC for classification of celebrity vs. landmarks during sleep across all our subjects (y-axis).  This was calculated by performing cross-validation (somewhere between 15-fold and 40-fold depending on the number of sleep patterns available) using all frequencies z-scored across electrodes for a particular timebin (x-axis).

**Figure 2b)** We plot the p-values for combinations of subjects and time bins with sleep cross-validation AUC values that are calculated via a shuffled permutation test whereby the labels of the classes are shuffled, we train a classifier with the shuffled patterns, and look at the cross-validation AUC for this shuffled dataset. Areas in red have p-values > 0.05.
