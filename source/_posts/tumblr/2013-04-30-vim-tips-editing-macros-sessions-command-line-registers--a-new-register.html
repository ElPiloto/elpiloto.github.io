<h1>Edit macro</h1>
1. Record the macro: I'm gunna assume you've already recorded a macro to register <code>f</code><br>
2. Open a new area to edit the macro (this could be in your current window, but I'd prefer to do it in a new split):  <code>:sp new ENTER</code><br>
3. Paste the macro contents as if they were a register! <code>"f</code>  This is the magic right here: I didn't realize macros were just stored as characters in a register!
4. Now modify the macro as you, please, yank it back <code>fy</code> after selecting it visually or otherwise<br>
5. Finally use your modified macro: <code>@f</code><br>
6. Feel like a f<code>*</code>ckin' boss<br><br>

<h1>Vim Sessions:</h1>

You can use the <code>:mksession</code> command to create a vim script that will restore your current editing session.  By default, :mksession will save your currently opened buffers, the current directory, tabs, splits, and folds you have open, but you can add more things by modifying the "sessionoptions" variable.  You can save multiple sessions by calling the :mksession command with an argument specifying the session name, which you can later invoke to load a particular session.<br><br>

<h2>Example 1: Using the generic session specifier</h2>

Open up vim and open up a few tabs or splits or whatever you normally do when you're coding.

Save the session: <code>:mksession ENTER</code> - this will save our session to a file named Session.vim, which is the default session name.

Quit vim: :qa<br>

Start vim with the default session name: vim -S
<br><br>
Example 2: Saving and loading a specific session:
Just like before, open up vim normally and open up random tabs and files and splits and whatchamajiggers.
Save the session with the name your_splits_give_them_to_me: :mks your_splits_give_them_to_me (Notice that we can specify a file name that doesn&#8217;t end in .vim and also that we can abbreviate :mksession to :mks)
Quit vim: :qa
Start vim with the session name your_splits_give_them_to_me: vim -S your_splits_give_them_to_me

	<h1>COMBO SECTION: Paste register into the command line and the new register I learned!</h1>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s useful to use the contents of a register in a command.  For instance, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re editing a bash script, <em>bludgeon.sh</em>, and you want to actually test it before you continue adding functionality to the script.</p>
<ul><li>How a naive user might do this:</li>
</ul><p>           Exit vim<br/>           Execute the script: bash bludgeon.sh<br/>           Open the file in vim again: vim bludgeon.sh</p>
<ul><li>How a less naive user might do this:</li>
</ul><p>           Execute a command from the terminal using vim&#8217;s filter (!) by typing: ":! bash bludgeon.sh"</p>
<ul><li>How I would do this:</li>
</ul><p>           Instead of typing out bludgeon.sh, use the special % register to paste the filename into vim&#8217;s command line:</p>
<p>           ":! bash &lt;Ctrl-r&gt;%"</p>
<p>That explains two tips:</p>
<p>The % register which contains the name of the file you&#8217;re currently editing.</p>
<p>Pasting a register into vim&#8217;s command-line: &lt;Ctrl-r&gt; register</p>
<p>TADA!  Happy VIM&#8217;ing!</p>
