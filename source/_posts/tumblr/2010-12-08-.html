<p>This clip gives a brief overview of the computer vision system used to navigate the desert in the DARPA contest.  While the technical merits of the computer vision system are to be lauded, the most striking aspect of this video is the reasoning used to achieve the desired functionality in the face of the seemingly insurmountable task of navigating a car based on computer vision.</p>
<p>"The hard part is to use the image.  The car has to know what certain colors and things mean in the images. We put a lot of thought into the system. First we thought about finding obstacles, but it turns out that&#8217;s really hard. <strong>That&#8217;s almost impossible</strong> because anything can be an obstacle. We&#8217;ve had bushes in the desert, you can have stones, you can have tank tracks. You can have just about anything. And Stanley is not yet ready to learn all of these things. <strong>But what he can do </strong>is learn how the road looks like. We&#8217;ve been teaching him while he&#8217;s driving what the road looks like."</p>
<p>While researchers are hungry for solutions to AI-complete problems, it is becoming increasingly evident that we can achieve useful results in artificial intelligence without having to solve intractable tasks.  The clever formulation of Stanley&#8217;s vision task is a sufficient exemplar of this idea, but this notion did not arise in the realm of artificial intelligence.  In fact, how many flustered parents, having failed at convincing a young tyke to behave from a disciplinary perspective, have finagled their tiny tot into thinking that sitting still was a game to be won and subsequently, if only temporarily, enjoyed the sweet serenity of their success? (I still can&#8217;t believe my parents tricked me with this as a child - sitting still as a &#8220;game" is like sitting for an hour in the dentist&#8217;s waiting room to get your teeth drilled!)</p>
