    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-hippocampus-in-space-and-time">The hippocampus in space and time</h1>

<h2 id="lets-start-with-space">Let’s start with space</h2>
<p>How the crap do we reconcile memory and location functions of hippocampus?   </p>

<p>Two relevant pieces of evidence:  <br />
1. hippocampus essential for episodic memory (Vargha-Khadem , Science 1997)    </p>

<ol>
  <li>episodic memories are organized in space and time  (Tulving, Organization of Memory, 1972)    </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong> hippocampus organizes memories in space and time   </p>

<p>context-guided object association:
key point: forces animal to organize memories spatially   </p>

<p>two connected rooms: <br />
- same pair of compounds “A and B” in each room; one compound is positive in one room, negative in the other and vice versa      </p>

<p>hippocampus neurons highly dimensional:   <br />
- have firing selective to item (compound) AND location     </p>

<h2 id="how-are-these-dimensions-organized-within-hippocampus">How are these dimensions organized within hippocampus?</h2>

<p>to do so, upscaled task:
some trials have same rooms, but different compounds “C and D” (with same positive/negative versions in each room)</p>

<p>can look at:
item identity (A v B v C v D) vs. valence (AC v BD) vs. pair (AB v CD)</p>

<p>Also, recording from ensembles of neurons (instead of looking for individual cells that are responsive) and perform multivariate representational similarity analysis    </p>

<p>position: same item, different item, change valence, change pair</p>

<h4 id="punchline">Punchline</h4>
<p>Look at RSA across different manipulations and find that representation is most sensitive in decreasing order to :context, position, valence, item     </p>

<p>Also looked at this hierarchy in orbitofrontal cortex and found that the hierarchy is swapped (see that it cares more about valence which is consistent with what we expect from OFC)   </p>

<h2 id="how-is-memory-space-managed">How is “memory space” managed?</h2>
<p>Must be some activity between PFC and (dorsal) hippocampus:</p>

<p><strong>Idea:</strong> record from hippocampus, inactivate PFC with muscimol, re-record from hippocampus  </p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> found that cell that fire to item A and context 2, would subsequently fire to both item A and context 2     – although it seems like maybe they’re talking baout recording from mPFC?   </p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-origin-of-contextual-information-to-prefrontal-cortex">What is the origin of contextual information to prefrontal cortex?</h3>

<p>Perhaps this is the flow of communication
1. details –&gt; context generated from dorsal hippocampus –&gt; ventral
2. ventral hippocampus –&gt; PFC carrying contextual information
3. PFC –&gt; dorsal hippocampus to select relevant information</p>

<p>look at J. Neuro 2010 phase lag at theta between areas to see if we can determine flow of information <br />
found -103ms DHipp, -27ms VHipp, and mPFC 64ms    </p>

<h2 id="what-about-time">What about time?</h2>

<p>Do you need a hippocampus for memory for temporal order? (Fortin et al. Nature Neuro 2002)  <br />
Experiment: learn sequence of 5 stimuli, test: which of two stimuli came earlier? <br />
Look at behavior as a function of normal vs. hippocampal lesions
Also tested for recognition and found lesion animals not deficient - seems like hippocampus must play an important role in memory for temporal order    </p>

<h4 id="how-does-the-hippocampus-tell-time">How does the hippocampus tell time</h4>
<p>Kraus et al. Neuron, 2013 - figure 8 task, but confounded with position, so how do we isolate time?   <br />
Keep rat on treadmill, then find “time cells” which fire at a particular time point     </p>

<p>but could potentially confound time elapsed and distance, so vary treadmill rate and found in fact both time cells and distance cells   <br />
but actually found that there’s a distribution of cells which actually respond to some combination of time and distance, but the time-only and distance-only cells are at the tails of that distribution    </p>

<h2 id="general-knowledge">General Knowledge:</h2>
<p>ventral hippocampus: bigger place fields, generally take up whole context; develop a bit slower than dorsal hippocampus  <br />
dorsal hippocampus: more specific, smaller place fields; develop place field selectivity perfectly correlated with learning    <br />
monosynapse from ventral hippocampus to PFC   </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="importance-maps">Importance Maps:</h2>

<p>It turns out that we have been re-scaling (the eeg_ana_toolbox traintest function) features when performing classification.  This is arguably an okay thing to do in general, BUT DEFINITELY NOT OKAY to do when calculating McDuff importance maps which rely on looking at the average pattern activation signs and the signs of the weights because the weights were generated for a rescaled (always between 0 and 1) pattern, so that it doesn’t make sense to look at the sign agreement between the two for calculating the McDuff importance maps.  </p>

<h2 id="generating-sleep-transformed-plots">Generating Sleep Transformed Plots:</h2>
<p>Since it has been working, for the purposes of generating a wake template, we’re going to use the RFE results generated by performing feature selection on the raw feature weights (instead of McDuff importance)</p>

<h4 id="additionally-there-was-some-concern-that-we-might-be-z-scoring-across-electrodes-after-each-rfe-iteration-but-really-thats-not-what-we-think-we-should-be-doing-and-luckily-not-what-were-doing-in-the-code">Additionally, there was some concern that we might be z-scoring across electrodes after each RFE iteration, but really that’s not what we think we should be doing and <em>luckily</em> <strong>not</strong> what we’re doing in the code!</h4>

<h4 id="we-have-a-preference-for-more-textured-templates-and-using-the-correlation-instead-of-the-dot-product-because-the-correlation-is-scale-invariant">We have a preference for more “textured” templates and using the correlation instead of the dot product because the correlation is scale-invariant</h4>

<h4 id="stucture">Stucture:</h4>
<p>We want to generate a “flipbook” for every pair of wake time-freq bin we choose (roughly 6) and each corresponding sleep frequency.  Given 5 frequency bands and 6 wake templates, we’ll end up with roughly 30 flipbooks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="as-described-in-a-hrefhttpelpilotogithubioblog20140925sleep-eeg-replicating-best-p-val-resultsthis-posta-there-was-a-bug-that-messed-things-up-for-the-results-posted-a-hrefhttpelpilotogithubioblog20140904sleep-eeg-finding-optimal-wake-pattern-for-sleep-transformherea">As described in <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/blog/2014/09/25/sleep-eeg-replicating-best-p-val-results/">this post</a>, there was a bug that messed things up for the results posted <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/blog/2014/09/04/sleep-eeg-finding-optimal-wake-pattern-for-sleep-transform/">here</a></h3>

<p>In general, we were producing a non-random, though erroneous, transformation to our data so now that that bug is fixed we should be getting pretty similar results just along different times and frequencies.   </p>

<h4 id="nothing-has-changed-for-the-optimal-lambda-choice">Nothing has changed for the optimal lambda choice:</h4>
<p>Still seems pretty close between the two, but let’s stick with <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/images/research/LOSO_POSTBUG/LOSO_WAKE_LOGREG_POST_BUG_face_sceneAUC_lambda10.png">$\lambda = 10$</a> over <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/images/research/LOSO_POSTBUG/LOSO_WAKE_LOGREG_POST_BUG_face_sceneAUC_lambda50.png">$\lambda = 50$
</a></p>

<h4 id="looking-for-best-timebin-and-frequency">Looking for best timebin and frequency:</h4>
<p>previously we liked <strong>300 ms</strong> time bin and were slightly frequency agnostic based on <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/images/research/LOSO_sleep_transform/LOSO_WAKE_LOGREG_SWEEP_PVAL_face_sceneAUC_lambda10.png">this</a>, but now we get totally different looking results:</p>

<p><a href='/images/research/LOSO_POSTBUG/LOSO_WAKE_LOGREG_POST_BUGPVAL_face_sceneAUC_lambda10.png' target='_blank'><img src="/images/research/LOSO_POSTBUG/LOSO_WAKE_LOGREG_POST_BUGPVAL_face_sceneAUC_lambda10.png" width="700" height="350"></a></p>

<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Cool things: we’re getting something around when you’d expect to see the N170 for faces!  We were getting hints of this when we were doing individual subject classification, but it seems that this is the only thing from the <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/images/research/sleep_eeg_hilbert/wake_hilb_mean_across_subjects.png">subject-specific classification</a> that comes through in the LOSO analysis (although we also get other strongly classifiable time bins in the LOSO analsis, it’s just that those didn’t pop out in the subject-specific classification results).  <strong>SO</strong>, I say let’s generate transformed sleep data plotaccording to four or five different patterns: 
	- something in the 4 Hz, 125-275 ms timebin range
	- something in the 4 Hz, 450-600 ms timebin range
	- something in the 4 Hz, 725-925 ms timebin range
	- something in the 8 Hz, 100-175 ms timebin range 
	- something in the 8 Hz, 275-325 ms timebin range   </p>

<p>This will be A LOT of plots to look at, but if we see something we can always check on James’ second batch of spindle-cued subjects.</p>

<h4 id="lets-look-at-the-recursive-feature-analysis-results-for-lambda--10">Let’s look at the recursive feature analysis results for $\lambda = 10$</h4>
<p>And see what’s the best we get across the different time bins for the 4 Hz and 8 Hz frequencies at some points that we cared about: <del>- I’m working on presenting these in a better fashion but for now these are the plots that were most easily generated:</del>   </p>

<h4 id="additionally-lets-look-at-wake-loso-classification-using-just-erps">Additionally, let’s look at wake LOSO classification using just ERPs:</h4>
<p>Well, this is awkward: our best classification results are for using the ERPs: 68% accuracy.</p>

<h4 id="so-far-ive-tried">So far I’ve tried:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Running the same exact analysis (driver_LOSO_replicate_PVAL.m)   </li>
  <li>Running the same exact analysis but only classifying between faces and scenes via:
<code>preprocessing.type_specifics_args.classes = [1 2];</code>    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>this did not help   </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try loading up results from Sept 09, and regenerating plots - will indicate whether or not something changed in plots or results. <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Doing this, I’ve found that the results of interest are specifically in this file:  <br />
<code> 09-Sep-2014_14_04_44LOSO_WAKE_logreg_sweep.mat </code>   </li>
      <li>I’ve found that it is in fact for $ \lambda = 10 $ (I was worried I might have accidentally documented the wrong value of $\lambda$)       </li>
      <li>We were classifying against all 5 classes (validating our findings above that classifying only faces vs scenes did not reproduce the results)   </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try duplicating exact time range used originally, perhaps there is some bug in my code <br />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BAD NEWS:</strong> this reproduced the results, meaning there has to be some BUG in my code where I reshape the data, append subject data together, OR iterate through individual timebins and frequencies. This is why it would be nice to have the time to create some simulated data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixing-the-damn-bug">FIXING THE DAMN BUG</h3>
<p>Relevant files:  </p>

<p>So far, I’ve ensured that when I reshape and permute the subject’s data after loading it (<code>get_preprocessed_subj_data.m, Line: 128 </code>), that I have not messed up the ordering of the data.</p>

<p>Next: when I filter timebins out, do I mess that process up?  This also checks out(<code>get_preprocessed_subj_data.m, Line: 60 </code>)   </p>

<p>Next: what about when I call <code>iterate_over_data</code>?  The data was misordered here, so somewhere between <code>get_preprocessed_subj_data</code> and <code>iterate_over_data</code> we messed things up.</p>

<p>Next: let’s check that the anonymous function that is used for reshaping the data (after it’s been flattened) is correct, this gets used in a few places.  YEP, this is the problem: someone please kindly shoot me in the face.   </p>

<h3 id="bug-the-sequel-discrepancy-between-the-recursive-feature-elimination-results-and-logistic-regression-results">BUG, The Sequel: DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE RECURSIVE FEATURE ELIMINATION RESULTS AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION RESULTS</h3>
<p>I’ve verified that there is no discrepancy between the accumulated values and the plotted values, so it does not seem to be the case that the plotting function is messing things up.   </p>

<p>Recursive feature elimination (RFE) analysis has a setting for the minimum number of features i.e. remove features until we hit some minimum number of features.  In general, this is set to 1, so that we can see the effect of removing 0 to all but one features (electrodes).  I have found that if I set that value to 60 (only removing 4 features), then the RFE results align with the logistic regression results, however, if I set that to 1 or even just 50, the results stop lining up.  Very, very perplexing.    </p>

<p>Next, let’s look at the features used for the first and second iteration with different settings (60 and 50) of the minimum number of features.  If they differ in any way, then the code for removing features must be incorrect and we can delve into that.<br />
   - So for the second iteration, the fourth frequency, the RFE results have different features they’ve removed.  WTF, mate?   A reasonable next step would be to look at the values passed into the <code>remove_unused_features</code> for both parameter settings and see if they are the same.</p>

<p>Looking at the classifier weights for the first iteration of the fourth frequency for both parameter settings, we see that they have different values, so naturally removing features would produce different removed features for the second iteration.  Additionally, this implies there is something different being fed into the classifier for the first iteration that is producing different feature weights.</p>

<p><strong>HERE IT IS:</strong>  Currently, we’ve been doing an RFE iteration (going from 64 features down to minimum num_features) for each frequency bin (2 Hz all the way up to 32 Hz).  To maintain the correct level of regularization, we take the max number of features (64) and look at the ratio of regularization (usually 10) to the number of features and keep this proportional as we remove more and more features.  The bug was that between RFE iterations (i.e. starting anew at 4 Hz, after doing 2 Hz), the regularization ratio was calculating using the previous iteration’s last number of features (not the max number of features) - so as we moved from 2 Hz to 32 Hz, our results got more and more skewed from the regular logistic regression results because we were using much smaller regularization.  This is fixed now!</p>

<p>N170 is really sharp, maybe at 8 Hz and 225ms, large over Cz sometimes (doesn’t make a lot of sense anatomically - you’d expect it to be over occipital)</p>
