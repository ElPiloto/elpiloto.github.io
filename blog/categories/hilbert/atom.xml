<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Average AUC on Hilbert-transformed wake data across all subjects for each time bin and frequency band combination.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> We see “hotspots” where we were hoping to see them: at the theta frequency around 200-230ms. Moreover, we see that the 200-230ms theta bin forms a local peak: as you move earlier or later in time, classification accuracy decreases.  Importantly, the accuracy using these bands (as opposed to individual frequencies like we had before) yields comparable average wake classification across subjects if we look at this <a href="http://ElPiloto.github.io/images/research/sleep_eeg_9_subjects_06_23_2014/wake_auc_avgd.png">old plot</a>.  If this result holds for all subjects, then we would feel pretty good about using the 200ms (or 230ms) theta time-freq bin to transform the sleep data.  Therefore, let’s look at the individual subjects to see if these results are driven by some subjects or if they seem to be pretty evenly distributed (spoiler: doesn’t seem to be a good time-freq bin, or even classifiable, for all subjects, but it does pretty well)</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> AUC heatmaps of classification AUC per subject.  Subject IDs are along the top of each subplot, timebins run along the y-axis and frequencies along the x-axis (only explicitly marked for the last subject, but the axes are exactly the same as Figure 1).</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> These plots, though informative, suck for the purpose of evaluating how good the 200-250ms, theta bins do across all subjects.  Let’s zoom in on the areas of interest below.  One additional point, is that we’re getting <strong>much</strong> better max AUC across timebins than previously before (using individual frequencies) suggesting that the Hilbert transform is a better preprocessing technique for classification.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong>  Above we show the AUC for each subject for 3 different times (200, 225, and 250ms respectively) for the 4 Hz (theta) frequency band.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This isn’t the greatest, especially considering some subjects have time-freq bins with much higher AUC.  “Irregardless,” these results are sufficiently positive to justify transforming sleep data.  Everything that we said about the non-band wake analyses holds here (e.g. we can look at other bins that look good for subjects, we can take each subject’s best bin to transform the data, etc).</p>
