    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="where-and-how-is-state-represented">Where and how is state represented?</h1>

<p>Perhaps OFC is a cognitive map of task space? as suggested in paper of similar title by Bob Wilson, … Yael Niv   </p>

<p>Represents map of states in current task   </p>

<h3 id="predicitons-of-current-study">Predicitons of current study:</h3>

<p>activitiy patterns in OFC should allow us to discriminate between hidden states   </p>

<p>similarity of OFC state representations should represent distance in task space    </p>

<h3 id="stimuli">Stimuli</h3>

<p>Young/old faces overlaid on old/modern houses   </p>

<h3 id="task">Task</h3>
<p>Trial 1:  What is the age of the currently attended image?  Need to attend to faces or houses (this is latent state during task, because instructed at start of trial) <br />
Trial 2:  If age of currently attended image changes, next trial will have to switch attention to opposite stimulus type (e.g. from faces to houses)   </p>

<h3 id="what-constitutes-a-state">What constitutes a state?</h3>
<p><strong>Dimensions of State:</strong> <br />
1. category of previous trial  <br />
2. age of prev. trial  <br />
3. category current trial  <br />
4. age of current trial   </p>

<h3 id="behavioral-data">Behavioral Data</h3>
<p>Rewarded if stay below error   </p>

<h3 id="classification-analsysis">Classification Analsysis</h3>
<p>estimate activation pattern associated with each state <br />
- train classifier to discriminate between states <br />
- assess which dimensions classifier can distinguish   </p>

<h4 id="ofc-encodes-most-dimensions-of-state-spate">OFC encodes most dimensions of state spate</h4>
<p>prev category *
prev age (p = 0.06) <br />
current category * <br />
current age  - doesn’t get encoded, for some reason   </p>

<p>DLPFC and Hippo: Less information than OFC   </p>

<h3 id="relations-of-states">Relations of States:</h3>
<p>Basically look at state transition matrix, cluster according to successor representation    </p>

<p>See reliable difference in correlation between states with same successor representation minus correlation between states with different successor representation in OFC    </p>

<p>Size of effect in OFC has <strong>strong</strong> correlation with amount of errors   </p>

<p>Also see: hippocampus, DLPFC, auditory cortex, and visual cortex   </p>

<p>So then what does this mean? Perhaps multiple areas involved in this task?  That seems likely, but what is the role of OFC in this?     </p>
